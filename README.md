A **C++** compendium of Bayesian statistical routines for **R** packages

<!-- badges: start -->

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/bsvars/StealLikeBayes/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bsvars/StealLikeBayes/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a compendium of C++ routines useful for Bayesian statistics. We
steal other people’s C++ code, repurpose it, and export it so developers
of R packages can use it in their C++ code. We actually don’t steal
anything, or claim that Thomas Bayes did, but copy code that is
compatible with our GPL 3 licence, fully acknowledging the authorship of
the original code.

## How to contribute

You are welcome to contribute to **StealLikeBayes**! How does this work?

### Things to remember

- We only accept code from packages and repositories with compatible
  licences. If you are contributing code from a package distributed
  under **GPL 3** you’re good. Otherwise, you must argue the licence
  compatibility.
- Fully acknowledge the source of the contributed code in the file with
  your code and documentation.
- Provide one Bayesian statistical routine per submission.
- Your submission must consist of:
  - one **C++** file, `src/*.cpp`
  - the corresponding **C++** header file, `src/*.h`
  - one **R** file with a wrapper for your main **C++** function,
    `R/*.R` with full documentation and acknowledgement of the original
    code authorship,
  - one **R** file with tests of your function, `inst/tinytest/*.R`,
  - Updates on dependencies in `DESCRIPTION` and
    `R/StealLikeBayes-package.R`,
  - updates on your authorship in `DESCRIPTION`.

### Instructions from the issue template

- [ ] Fork the repository
  [bsvars/StealLikeBayes](https://github.com/bsvars/StealLikeBayes).
- [ ] Include your **C++** file, `src/[main_routine].cpp`, named after
  the main routine/function you’re contributing called `[main_routine]`.
  - [ ] Acknowledge the authorship of the source code in this file in
    line with its licence requirements.
  - [ ] Export all **C++** functions by including **Rcpp** directives
    `// [[Rcpp::interfaces(cpp)]]` and `// [[Rcpp::export]]`.
  - [ ] Write and **R** wrapper only for the main function you
    contribute.
- [ ] Include the corresponding **C++** header file,
  `src/[main_routine].h` with all your **C++** functions.
- [ ] Include one **R** file with a wrapper for your main **C++**
  function, `R/[main_routine].R`.
  - [ ] This function must include argument type checks using
    `stopifnot()`.
  - [ ] Include full documentation using **roxygen2** that must have all
    necessary elements including:
  - [ ] the description of arguments and values, also described in terms
    of the **C++** objects,
  - [ ] the acknowledgement of the original code authorship in
    `@details` with explicit references to the **R** package where the
    original code comes from listed in `@references`, and to the package
    defining the class of **C++** inputs and outputs,
  - [ ] your authorship acknowledgement in section `@authors`,
  - [ ] an example of the **R** function use in `@examples`.
- [ ] Include an **R** file with tests of your contributed **R**
  function, `inst/tinytest/[main_routine].R`,
- [ ] Update on dependencies in `DESCRIPTION` and
  `R/StealLikeBayes-package.R`.
- [ ] Update on your authorship in `DESCRIPTION`, using `person()`. In
  `comment` include your `ORCID` and `contributions`, for instance
  `contributions = "contributions: [main_routine]"`.
- [ ] Update the `NEWS.md` by providing the `[main_routine]`, your
  GitHub profile login, and a link to this issue.
- [ ] Push your commits linking them all to your issue by including the
  hash tag of your issue.
- [ ] Run checks of the package locally. They all need to pass!

## How to use the package **StealLikeBayes**

Please, feel free to use it whatever way you feel like, ofc! We create
it with two intended uses:

### Use our **C++** code in your **R** package

In order to use our **C++** code in your **R** package you need to
ensure you include all the dependencies to both: our package, and
packages on which our functions rely on such as **RcppArmadillo**. The
latter is on you!

To use **C++** code from **StealLikeBayes** follow the steps:

- [ ] Include dependencies in your `DESCRIPTION` file, e.g.:
  `LinkingTo: StealLikeBayes`.
- [ ] Include our header in your `src/*.cpp` files, e.g.:
  `#include "StealLikeBayes.h"`.
- [ ] Use our functions in your **C++** code, e.g.:

<!-- -->

    arma::vec out = StealLikeBayes::rnorm1_precision_sampler(zeros<vec>(10), ones<vec>(10), -0.5);

### Use our **R** code in your **R** package

That’s simple!

- [ ] Include dependencies in your `DESCRIPTION` file, e.g.:
  `Depends: StealLikeBayes`.
- [ ] Include dependencies in your `R/*-package.R` file,
  e.g. `@importFrom StealLikeBayes rnorm1_precision_sampler`.
- [ ] Use our functions in your **R** code, e.g.:

<!-- -->

    out = StealLikeBayes::rnorm1_precision_sampler(rep(0, 10), rep(1, 10), -0.5)

## Installation

You can install the development version of **StealLikeBayes** like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("bsvars/StealLikeBayes)
```
