Description: 
  This is a compendium of C++ routines useful for Bayesian statistics. We steal 
  other people's C++ code, repurpose it, and export it so developers of R 
  packages can use it in their C++ code. We actually don't steal anything, or 
  claim that Thomas Bayes did, but copy code that is compatible with our GPL 3 
  licence, fully acknowledging the authorship of the original code.
