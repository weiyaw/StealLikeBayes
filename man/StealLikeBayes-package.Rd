\title{A C++ compendium of Bayesian statistical routines for R packages}
\description{
This is a compendium of C++ routines useful for Bayesian 
statistics. We steal other people's C++ code, repurpose it, and export it so 
developers of R packages can use it in their C++ code. We actually don't 
steal anything, or claim that Thomas Bayes did, but copy code that is 
compatible with our GPL 3 licence, fully acknowledging the authorship of the 
original code.
